## Project Overview

Our group was tasked with stealing twitter data from mayors of American cities over 30,000 people, putting it into a database, and analyzing it.The database can be found here: <https://wustl.app.box.com/file/289481874492>.



## Visualization of data

I have succesfully embedded a plot and am proud of myself

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
load("mayor_Covariates.rds")
ggplot(data=mayor_Covariates)+geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = verified)) +labs(title = "Verificatation of Mayoral Twitter Accounts")
```
